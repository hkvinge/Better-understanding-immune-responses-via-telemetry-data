Run the "__main__" of example.py for a minimal example 
using a synthetic timeseries transitioning from one 
noisy sinusoid to another. 

tde.py contains a simple time delayed embedding code 
for a scalar timeseries input.

mset.py has an implementation of MSET to operate 
on an arbitrary vector timeseries.
